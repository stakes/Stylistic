Stylistic
=========

Stylistic is a gem that makes it easy to get started on a nice-looking Rails project.

It bundles some kickass open-source HTML and CSS "frameworks" and boilerplate code, includes jQuery replacement as a convenience and basically turns new Rails projects superstylistic in seconds.
